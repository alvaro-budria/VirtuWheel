# VirtuWheel
### A 3D Driving Simulator with Body Pose Control


VirtuWheel is a 3D driving simulator that offers a unique experience by allowing users to control the steering wheel using their body pose. In contrast to traditional simulators that require specific hardware like a physical steering wheel and gear shift, our system only needs a regular laptop and a budget camera. The simulator immerses users in a realistic real-world environment, enhancing the driving experience while making it more accessible.
